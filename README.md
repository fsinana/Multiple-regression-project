# Multiple Regression Analysis for Predicting City mpg

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook implements a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict City Miles Per Gallon (MPG) based on various vehicle attributes. The dataset used undergoes preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to ensure optimal performance.
## Key Insights
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which independent variables significantly impact the dependent variable.
- **Multicollinearity Detection**: Checking for highly correlated predictors that may affect model performance.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Evaluating R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine model effectiveness.
- **Overfitting & Underfitting**: Analyzing whether the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Interpretability**: Understanding how each feature contributes to the predictions.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install missing dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Contents
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships and distributions.
- **Model Training**: Implementing multiple linear regression using `sklearn`.
- **Evaluation**: Checking model performance using R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Predictions**: Making and interpreting predictions.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`multiple.regression.ipynb`).
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. Modify and experiment with the code as needed.
